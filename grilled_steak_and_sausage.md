# Grilled Steak and Sausage

## Ingredients
* **Steak** 
* **2 cloves of garlic** crushed
* **Pink himalayan salt** 
* **Montreal steak seasoning** 
* **Pepper** ground
* **Garlic salt**
* **1/2 stick of butter** melted and cooled to room temperature
* **2 sheets of aluminum foil**
* **Olive oil**


## Steak
- Clean the grill by scraping with a brush
- Start to pre-heat the grill to medium heat (around 350 degrees)
- Rub cloves of garlic on steak
- Lightly coat steak with olive oil on both sides. It is important to get the bottom as well so it does not stick to the aluminum foil when you try to flip it
- Sprinkle pink himalayan salt, Montreal steak seasoning, and ground black pepper on steak
- Melt butter and add garlic salt. Let cool to room temperature
- Place steaks on aluminum foil (double wrapped) and fold each side up. You want to make sure that when you start basting with butter, none of it is able to leave the aluminum foil
- Place steaks and alumimum foil on grill and continually baste with the room temperature melted garlic salt butter
- To achieve a steak that is medium done, a good rule of thumb is for each 1 inch thick you want it to spend about 10 minutes on the grill. Assuming the steak is 1-inch thick, cook for 5 minutes on each side, continually basting the steak with the butter so it never gets dry
- Take steak off the grill. Heat up a pan with olive oil on high heat, then sear each side of the steak for 1-2 minutes
- Let sit for 10 minutes, then serve

## Sausage 
- Pre-heat grill to low heat (around 275 degress)
- Place directly on grill and turn every 2 minutes
- After 20 minutes, take off the grill and serve
