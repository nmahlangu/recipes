# Wiener Schnitzel

## Ingredients
* Pork
* 2 eggs
* Flour
* Bread Crumbs
* Canola or Grape Seed Oil

## Directions
* Put flour, 1-2 eggs, and bread crumbs on a plate, each on its own plate
* Take a large piece of pork and cover both sides of it with the flour in the first plate
* Take the same piece of pork and cover both sides with egg (this serves as a "glue" for the breadcrumbs) from the second plate
* Take the same piece of pork and cover both sides with bread crumbs from the third plate
* Heat oil in a frying pan (a lot, the meat should swim in it). Once hot, put the pork into the pan and let it cook for a few minutes. Once it's light brown on one side, flip it over and cook the other side for a few minutes
* Take the meat out of the pan and dab it with a paper towel to get some of the oil off
* If making multiple pieces, turn the oven on low heat and put the meat in that's already done while you are frying other pieces
