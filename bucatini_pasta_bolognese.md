# Bucatini Pasta Bolognese

## Ingredients
* Ground beef (10 ounces)
* Bucatini pasta (6 ounces)
* Brussel sprouts (4 ounces)
* Garlic (2 cloves)
* Carrot (1)
* Celery (1 stalk)
* Grated parmesan cheese (2 tablespoons)
* Tomato paste (2 tablespoons)
* Shallot (1)

## Directions
* Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Peel and mince the garlic and shallot. Peel and small dice the carrot. Small dice the celery. Cut off and discard the stem ends of the Brussels sprouts; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise.
* In a large, high-sided pan (or pot), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium until hot. Add the garlic, shallot, carrot and celery; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 4 minutes, or until softened and fragrant.
* Add the tomato paste to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until dark red and fragrant.
* Add the ground beef to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook, frequently breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 4 to 6 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Remove from heat.
* While the beef cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook 8 to 9 minutes, or until just shy of al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly and transfer to the pan of cooked aromatics and beef.
* Add the Brussels sprouts and Â¾ of the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until thoroughly coated. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining pasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the finished pasta between 2 dishes. Garnish with up to half the cheese (you will have extra cheese). Enjoy!
