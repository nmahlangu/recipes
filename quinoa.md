# Quinoa

## Ingredients
* Quinoa (1 cup)
* Water  (2 cups)
* Olive Oil (1 tablespoon)
* Crimini or Portabella sliced mushrooms (1 cup)
* Broccoli florets (1 cup)
* Onion (1/2 of it)
* Eggs (2)
* Garlic (1 clove)

## Directions
* Rinse and prepare Quinoa according to package - usually 1 cup quinoa, 2 cups water, takes like 15-20 minutes.
* While Quinoa is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat.
* Add mushrooms, try to make them an even layer.
* Slice the half onion and add it in on top.
* Sprinkle a thin layer of garlic on top, along with salt and pepper. 
* Wait one minute before you stir at all, then cook 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* Add the broccoli on top of the onions/mushrooms, turn heat down to medium-low, and cover (this will let the broccoli be steamed). Leave for 3 minutes.
* Turn heat back up to medium, uncover, push all vegetables to the side of the pan, and scramble the 2 eggs in the open half of the pan. Then mix it all together.
* Turn heat off if quinoa is still cooking.
* When Quinoa is done cooking, add approximately half of it to the vegetables and stir to combine (you may need to turn on the heat to heat it up).
* Serve after 1 minute of mixing
