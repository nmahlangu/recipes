# Stir Fry
Makes enough for 2 meals. For meal prep, double everything. 

## Ingredients
* **2 tbsp vegetable oil** or other high heat oil
* **1 pound beef sirloin (or chicken)** cut into thin strips, see note
* **2 cups broccoli** fresh florets
* **2 cups white mushrooms** cut into thin strips
* **1 red bell pepper** cut into thin strips
* **2 large carrots** peeled and cut into thin strips
* **2 green onions** thinly sliced
* **1 tsp garlic** minced
* **1/2 tsp ginger** freshly grated
* **1/2 tsp red pepper flakes**
* **2 tbsp soy sauce**
* **2 tbsp fish sauce**

## Directions
* Throughout entire recipe, do not overcrowd your wok. You're better off cooking in small batches, setting aside, and combining everything at the end. You want everything to have a nice sear on it but not be soggy and overly cooked.
* Ensure meat and all vegetables are cut prior to cooking.
* Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is near it's smoking point, add the mushrooms and cook them by themselves for 4 minutes. Then add the beef, mix thoroughly with the mushrooms, and cook 7 to 8 minutes. It will continue cooking after you take it off the head, so make sure not to overcook it. Transfer beef and mushrooms to a plate.
* Add more olive oil to the wok and heat on medium-high heat again. Once hot, add broccoli, bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, and green onion to the center of the wok. Cook and stir vegetables for 4 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, soy sauce, and fish sauce and stir well. Cook for 2 more minutes.
* Add beef and mushrooms back to the wok and stir everything together for 2 minutes on medium heat.
* Serve hot over rice or noodles.
